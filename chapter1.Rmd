### Thoughts about the course

I found the course by browsing possible courses to fill my credit need for my PhD. Right now I am a bit unsure if this is the right course for me. I am used to coding in python. I will probably not use R after the course and especially the markdown feels a bit of a waste of time to learn. (Edit: Visual Mode Helps a lot with Markdown)
